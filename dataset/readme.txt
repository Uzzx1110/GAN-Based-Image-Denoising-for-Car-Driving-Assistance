There are two folders in this dataset for C4MTS challenge:

For task 1: task1train540p has images and corresponding text files. It has total of 2000 samples for training.
Each text file has following line:
traffic_sign_type: x, y, w, h

traffic_sign_type is type of the traffic sign.
x is the x coordinate in pixels of top-left point of the traffic sign bounding box.
y is the y coordinate in pixels of top-left point of the traffic sign bounding box.
w is width of the bounding box in pixels.
h is height of the bounding box in pixels.

For task 2: task2train540p has 4 folders, one for each traffic sign. It has total of 1000 images with traffic signs inpainted for training. Participants are encouraged to create inpainting agnostic solutions as the test set will partially have real road scenes of missing traffic signs.

IMPORTANT NOTE 1: The data cannot be shared with anyone without permission of the organizers, and should be used only and only for the competetion. There is an adequate license involved while downloading from the IDD webstie.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Also, participants are not allowed to use data outside the competetion. Data for task 1 (1000 extra images) may be used for task2.
